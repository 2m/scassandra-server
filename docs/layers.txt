Priming
--------

Route/Web layer - Takes case classes that represent the JSON & pass them to the correct store

Slight difference between Queries and preapred statements:
- Queries are extracted from the JSON case classes prior to going to the store
- Prepared statement primes get passed directly.

TODO: Pick the better and make it consistent

Stores
------

Defaulting behaviour for queries is in the PrimeQueryResultExtractor

PrimeQueryStore
- Validates the prime, e.g do the values in the rows match the types?
- Stores the PrimeCriteria in with the Prime in a map

PrimePreparedStore
- Takes in a PrimePreparedSingle, extracts all the information
- Defaults consistencies to all
- Defaults variable types to varcahr
- Defaults column types to varchar
