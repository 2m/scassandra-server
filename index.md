###Overview

Scassandra server is written in Scala but we also have a Java wrapper for use with Java unit and integration tests.
If you're looking to test your Cassandra application then go to the [Java Client](www.scassandra.org/java-lcient).

Version 0.1 of Scassandra is primarily aimed at Java developers. The next version will have more focus on the standalone version of Scassandra.

However if you want to use Scassandra from a language/system other than Java, and you don't want to wait for version 0.2 then you are in the right place.
