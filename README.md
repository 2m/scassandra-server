# Scassandra - Making testing Cassandra easy

Stubbed Cassandra runs as a separate process that your application will believe is a real Cassandra node. It does this by implementing the server side of the binary protocol. It allows you to create scenarios like read time outs, write time outs and unavailable exceptions so you can test your application.

[See web site for documentation](http://www.scassandra.org/scassandra-server).
